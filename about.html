            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>I am based in the West Midlands, UK.  I come from a musical family where my dad played the banjo when I was growing up and my brothers all play a musical instrument.  I started my music journey by listening to wide varity genres of Gospel, RnB, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Country music.
                I decided one day to give it a try and I haven't stopped since! 
                I started playing the drums when I was about 10 years old, looking at other drummers I tried copy exactly what the experts do.
                I played at a church and then starting playing the drums for a steel and which was very enjoyable.  I then started to learn the piano at the age of 12.  I had no lessons initially and started playing the old piano in the living room.
                At the time we had cassette tapes and I would play my favourite songs and try to play along to them.  This was great training for me as I started to learn to play by ear.
                I then started getting involved in my church and they asked me to play.  It was nervous at first and I made a lot of mistakes, but it taught me patience and perseverance.
                I eventually took a few tution lessons to aid my learning and learn the fundamental techniques in drums and piano, as I did pick up a few bad habits along the way.</p>
                <h2>INFLUENCE</h2>
                <p>There are some great musicians out there and you will never be short of looking for an influencual figure.  My influence was heavily in gospel and grew up listening to bands like Commissioned, Kirk Franklin, The Winans and many more.
                    Jazz artists that shaped my music is Miles Davies, and more recent Snarky Puppy.  Drum influences are Dennis Chambers, and local drummers that influenced me who are now great drummers in their own right are Donovan Hepburn and Jonathon Rodney.</p>
                <h2>MENTAL HEALTH</h2>
            <p>Why do I play music? Music has always been a part of my life from when I was a child until present.  I have seen music as a get away, a time I can be myself to relax and just enjoy what I do.
                No matter what is happening in my life when I start to play a musical instrument I find a place of relaxation and I'm able to put any stress to one side.</p>
